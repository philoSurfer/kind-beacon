# Specification Quality Checklist: Full Web Core Vitals Metrics Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All validation criteria have been met:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification focuses entirely on WHAT and WHY without mentioning specific technologies (beyond referencing existing Lighthouse integration in dependencies). All content is written for business stakeholders to understand value and requirements.

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - No clarification markers needed - all requirements are well-defined with industry-standard assumptions
   - 14 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-014) are all testable and unambiguous
   - 8 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) are measurable and technology-agnostic
   - All user stories include detailed acceptance scenarios
   - Edge cases comprehensively identified (6 scenarios)
   - Scope boundaries clearly defined in Out of Scope section
   - Dependencies and assumptions explicitly documented

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
   - Three prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) cover all primary flows
   - Success criteria define measurable outcomes without implementation constraints
   - Specification maintains clear separation between requirements and implementation

## Notes

The specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning. No updates required.
