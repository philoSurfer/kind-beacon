- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Validation Results - Iteration 1

**Passing Items (13/14)**:
- ✅ Content Quality: All 4 items pass
- ✅ Requirement Completeness: 7/8 items pass (1 clarification needed)
- ✅ Feature Readiness: All 4 items pass

**Failing Items (1/14)**:
- ❌ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - **FR-013** contains: "should there be configurable rate limiting or concurrent processing options?"
  - **User response**: Option B - Concurrent with configurable limit

### Validation Results - Iteration 2 (Final)

**✅ ALL ITEMS PASS (14/14)**

**Clarification Resolved**:
- FR-013 updated to: "System MUST support concurrent processing of URLs with a configurable concurrency limit (default 3-5 URLs simultaneously)"
- FR-014 added: "System MUST allow users to configure the concurrency limit"
- Assumption 7 updated to reflect concurrent processing default

**Final Status**:
- ✅ Content Quality: 4/4 pass
- ✅ Requirement Completeness: 8/8 pass
- ✅ Feature Readiness: 4/4 pass

**Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`**
